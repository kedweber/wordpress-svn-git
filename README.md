# wordpress-svn-git
WordPress 4.8.0, developed in a Subversion repository, is loosely translated to Git here. 
This work is not maintained, supported, licensed nor under warranty by myself; details to which are replicated in 
markdown from the owners (viz. WordPress). It is to the best of my knowledge, just a simple way to use the evermore 
popular Git environment to peruse the code.
